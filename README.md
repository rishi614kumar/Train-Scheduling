# Train Scheduling Web Application

This web app is a pilot Train Scheduling system. It supports 3 User types (customer, employee, and admin), each with their own features. Customers are able to make reservations for train seats and message employees, employees are able to answer customer questions, and admins are able to modify, create, and delete train schedules.  

I collaborated with 4 others to create this project. We used Javascript, HTML, and SQL to build this web app. We hosted the project with AWS.


I worked on the schema, reservation making and canceling, messaging and alert system, and the login system.
